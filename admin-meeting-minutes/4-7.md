# 4/7 Admin Meeting

## Ongoing Enhancements

* Joe/Judy: Tagging system of users' various IDs
	 * Need to track
	  * Usernames for Steam/Riot/Battle.net/etc
		* ATTUID
		* Console type (per game?)
		* Interested games
		* Location (ie NJ)
	* Approaches:
		* Build custom bot that you can query for list of people interested in games
		* Use ranks (roles) to filter people by region, console type, interested games
			* Dyno or YAGPDB
		* For usernames, could use a profile bot
			* ProfileBot
	* Updates:
		* Joe - able to take GamerDB code and create a custom bot, bit right now we don't have a database to map to, also might not know how database is setup
		* GamerDB uses SQLite as a backend, think about doing the same for quickest setup
		* Custom Bot can deprecate use of public bots
			* User profile with ATTUId and Steam/Battle.net/other IDs (cannot store ATTUID in public dB, would absorb other aspects of user profile anyway)
			* Tracking location, console type, interested games (same functionality can be achieved through roles, but would complicate role management, especially for interested games that can have very expansive lists)
* Tim: Looking into collecting server metrics
	* Stat Bot (analytics and visualization for user activity)
	* MEE6/Tatsumaki (awarding "XP" and levels to users based on activity, form correlation for volunteer hours)
	* Updates:
		* Brute force, chat analytics, using Discord API
	* Caroleen: Looking into scoreboard
		* Scoreboarder
		* Might want to look into ELO bot in the future
## Wednesday Night (4/8) activities
* Options: Jackbodx, but not trivia, I'll get a poll bot running for deciding games and such
## Oxygen Discord Survey
* Went thru survey, didn't decide how/when to send it out thoâ€¦
## Oxygen Warner Games Collab
* Briefly went thru slide, sending over to phil
## Action items:
* Joe: Continue looking into custom implementation of GamerDB, speciifcally for tracking ATTUID to Discord user (and in tandem other IDs like Steam/Battle.net), prep for discussion about piggyback hosting on oxygen website server
* Judy: Look into YAGPDB to implement ranks to filter people by region (for national expansion), console type, and interested games. Aim to complete by scrum meeting next week
* Tim: Look into devleoping a correlation between discord server usage and volunteer hours. Aim to complete by scrum meeting next week. Specifiaclly:
	* How to extract metrics: Dicord API (customizable), Stat Bot (easiest), MEE6/Tatsumaki (future enhancements)
	* How to track ATTUID: most likely dependent on custom GamerDB bot due to SPI, can be manual for now while we are low population
	* A system that rewards volunteer hours for discord activity, but doesn't promote spam. Upt o you but some ideas include setting a limit of # of chats per week counting towards XP/volunteer hours, 1:1 correlation during "events"
	* An automatic tranlsation of discord activity to user activity, can be manual for now for low population
* Caroleen: Look into implementing the scoreboarder app as a way to keep a leaderboard of events, to trial with Monopoly (past event) and Jackbox (ongoing event)
* Raymond: Look into incorporating a poll bot (Poll Bot or Pollmaster) for uise to decide what jackbox games to play and for voting for future events, schedule call with John about oxygen webiste server piggybacking
 * Phil: Look over PPT email to Carolyn and send to her
